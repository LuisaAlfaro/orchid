# Orchid - Easy Server Management

Orchid is a script written in *closest possible* POSIX bash. This script aims
to provide an easy way to manage, create, destroy or deploy common server
applications. Orchid also lets you compile kernels and provides basic hardening
fot common depoyed applications.

## "The second record was called Morningrise"

Orchid was a personal server program originally written in C that tried to automate (or reduce keystrokes) in common server tasks on Debian based servers, due to it's unstable nature it crashed and caused a lot of trouble since it had poorly written C syscalls and code.

UpVent is now taking charge of this program, porting it completely to Bash.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

Bash script targeted to sysadmins and server managers who wish to save time.

---

Orchid was a personal server program originally written in C that tried to
automate (or reduce keystrokes) in common server tasks on Debian based servers,
due to it's unstable nature it crashed and caused a lot of trouble since it had
poorly written C syscalls and code.

UpVent is now taking charge of this program, porting it completely to Bash.


## DISCLAIMER

This script is still in testing phase, so it's results shouldn't be taken as
granted in any way possible, testing is welcome and after some triage features
will be considered stable and safe to use.

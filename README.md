Personal server script to automate common tasks (Might not work for everyone)

---


Orchid is my personal server script to automate (or reduce keystrokes) in common
server tasks based on Debian or Funtoo(WIP) based servers.

Script works on a module based system, called breeds (like orchid breeds) just
call the script, the name of the breed and use any commands available.

If you got any request about this script please open a PR or if you don't want
to code open an issue instead :smile: but that issue may or may not arrive soon
to orchid.

## DISCLAIMER

I've never tried to port to bash this script before, so, consider this version
as a highly experimental "alpha".

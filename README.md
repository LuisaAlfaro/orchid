# Orchid
Personal server script to automate common tasks (Might not work for everyone)

---


Orchid is my personal server script to automate (or reduce keystrokes) in common
server tasks based on Debian or Funtoo(WIP) based servers.

## DISCLAIMER

I've never tried to port to bash this script before, so, consider this version
as a highly experimental "alpha".

## TODO:

* Finish this README
* Add special functions for both Funtoo / Debian
* Automate apache settings
* Check for dependencies
